# [ARCH-00] ZFS (Zettelkasten File System) naming convention

## Filename formula
`[DOMAIN]-[LUHMANN_ID]_[slug].md`  — e.g. `PLAN-01a1_example_oauth.md`

## Rules
1. **DOMAIN**: 2–6 uppercase letters. A **closed whitelist** (enforced by `VALID_DOMAINS` in `scripts/zfs_util.js`):
   `ARCH INF PHASE CON PLAN MTG ANL FLOW WO WF LSN DOM TOOL EVD ADR PRO`. New domains are added to both code and docs only after `.union-stack/proposals` approval.
2. **LUHMANN_ID**: starts with a digit. Digit blocks and letter blocks alternate as it grows.
   Letters exclude **`l`/`o`** → `[a-km-np-z]` (blocks confusion with digits 1/0).
   A terminal task ends with `-[0-9]+`.
3. **slug**: snake_case starting with a lowercase letter. No spaces, hyphens, or uppercase.

## Deep linking
No relative paths. Reference only via bracket IDs like `[PLAN-01a1]` in body text → a global regex index.

## Lineage inference
- **Upward Fetching**: trim from the terminal to reverse-derive parents. `01a1-2`→`01a1`→`01a`→`01`.
  Automated: `node scripts/upward-fetch.js <ID>` — gathers parent PLAN/FLOW/CON/ARCH (space)
  and same-lineage LSN (time-axis pitfalls).
- **Blast Radius**: on edit/delete, index the descendants of the same lineage; if a Verifying
  node exists, Fail-close. (the alternation rule keeps `01a1` from mistaking `01a10` for a child)
  Automated: `node scripts/blast-radius.js <ID>` — exits 1 if a locked node exists.

## ID space — single and shared, with known aliasing ([ADR-25])
- The Luhmann coordinate space is **one space shared across domains** — same id in different
  domains = same lineage. That is the design (`CON-01a` ↔ `PLAN-01a`), not an accident.
- **Counter domains** (`TOOL`, `PRO`) allocate ids serially, *without* lineage intent. They therefore
  alias coordinates: `blast-radius TOOL-10` and `PRO-10` return the same impact set even though
  `TOOL-10` (smell linter) is unrelated to lineage 10 (measured 2026-08-18).
- **Ruling: the single space stays; no code split.** A domain-level rule cannot separate true coupling
  from false — `PRO-10 → WO-10a-1` is an intended edge while `TOOL-10 → WO-10a-1` is noise, and both
  ends live in counter domains. The discriminator is intent, which ID arithmetic cannot see; encoding
  intent would replace lineage inference (this file's core mechanism) with declared edges.
  `upward-fetch` is already immune via its `CONTEXT_DOMAINS` whitelist.
- **Discipline**: when anchoring a new lineage root, know that the low-number band is occupied by
  counters. Exposure is watched, not gated: `health.js` `lock exposure` (a false lock needs a
  `Verifying` doc in the aliased lineage — 0 today).
- **Reopen**: an actually observed false lock or GC block reopens the split proposal, with that
  incident as evidence.
