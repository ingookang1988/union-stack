# Migrating an existing project onto union-stack

## Two paths
- **Fresh / mostly empty repo** → run `node scripts/init.js --name "My Project" --apply` (seeds identity, strips dummies, resets manifests). Then fill in.
- **Existing doc-stack (6/7-doc, ad-hoc docs, wiki)** → map your files onto the plane using the table below, then validate with `node scripts/zfs-linter.js`.

## Mapping table (old → new home)
Copy this, fill the right column, then move files.

| Your existing artifact | union-stack home | Tier |
|---|---|---|
| project README / vision / scope / glossary | `.union-stack/project/IDENTITY*.md` | Schema |
| roadmap / milestones | `.union-stack/project/roadmap/PHASE-*` | Schema |
| strategic pivots / "why we changed direction" | `.union-stack/project/HISTORY.md` | Schema/Raw |
| architecture rules / layering / dependency norms | `.union-stack/architecture/ARCH-*` | Schema |
| deploy / DB / infra **decisions** | `.union-stack/architecture/infra/INF-*` | Schema |
| feature plans / requirements / intent | `.union-stack/plan/PLAN-*` | Schema |
| pre-plan discussion / meeting notes | `.union-stack/plan/meetings/MTG-*` | append-only |
| shared types / interfaces / test-tooling catalog | `.union-stack/reference/contracts/CON-*` | Schema |
| repeated-failure log / postmortems | `.union-stack/reference/lessons/LSN-*` | Wiki |
| domain models / formulas / theory | `.union-stack/reference/domain/DOM-*` | Schema |
| living feature map / what's shipped | `.union-stack/feature/` (live.md, flow/FLOW-*) | Wiki |
| current sprint / work orders | `.union-stack/sprint/` (next.md, WO-*/WF-*) | Wiki |
| session log / handoff | `.union-stack/sprint/HANDOFF.md` (latest), git = archive | Wiki |
| tactical decisions (ADRs) | `.union-stack/archive_ledger.md` | Raw (append) |
| CI logs / test output / drift notes | `.union-stack/verification/` (raw/ in, derived/ out) | Raw / Wiki |
| harness-rule change proposals | `.union-stack/proposals/PRO-*` | Proposal |
| throwaway experiments | `.union-stack/spike/` (no ZFS, ephemeral) | Wiki |

## Common patterns
- **flat → hierarchical**: a single big PLAN.md becomes `PLAN-01`, `PLAN-01a`, `PLAN-01a1` (ZFS lineage). Reference by bracket ID `[PLAN-01a]`, never by path.
- **monolith → decomposed**: split a 40KB+ doc by ZFS lineage; keep an index file and child nodes. See the rotation note below.
- **rename to ZFS**: `[DOMAIN]-[LUHMANN_ID]_[slug].md`; run `node scripts/zfs-linter.js` until clean.

## HISTORY 형식 — 표형과 헤딩형
`project/HISTORY.md` accepts **both** shapes, and `scripts/history-linter.js` / the dashboard time axis
count both. Pick one and keep it:

- **Table form (canonical).** `| Date | Turning point (fact) | Reason (why) | Implication |`.
  The columns *are* the contract, so a blank reason cell is a fact — the gate **REJECTs** it.
- **Heading form (natural for migrated projects).** `### YYYY-MM-DD — {title}` followed by
  `Context` / `Decision` / `Rationale` / `Impact`, as sub-headings or as `- **Rationale:** …` list rows.
  Reason labels recognised: `근거` `왜` `이유` `Reason` `Rationale` `Why`; implication labels:
  `시사점` `영향` `Impact` `Implication` `Note`.
  Free prose can't prove a reason is *absent*, so a heading entry with no reason label is **CLARIFY**
  (surfaced, never blocking) rather than REJECT.

If you migrated before this existed, your entries were silently counted as **0 turning points**. Nothing
to convert — re-run `node scripts/history-linter.js` and the count is real. To move to the table form,
one row per `###` block: date → Date, title → fact, `Rationale` → reason, `Impact` → implication.

## Adopting without `template-update` — the kit
If your copy was ported by hand (no `scripts/template-update.js`, no `.union-stack/template-sync.json`), fetch one dependency-free file and run it
from the repo root — **the first run only prints a plan**:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ingookang1988/union-stack/main/scripts/union-stack-kit.js -o scripts/union-stack-kit.js
node scripts/union-stack-kit.js            # dry-run
node scripts/union-stack-kit.js --apply    # fetches the 8 files template-update needs (only the ones you lack) and seeds the anchor
node scripts/template-update.js            # then the normal path: report → --apply
```

The anchor is labelled `clone@<version>(추정)` and records as "in sync" **only files that are byte-identical to upstream** (at the guessed clone tag,
default `v<your CHANGELOG version>`, or at `main`). Everything else stays *unknown*, so `template-update --apply` will not overwrite it until you
decide per file with `--force <path>`. Files you already have are never touched by the kit. (`template-update --seed <ref>` is the explicit
alternative: it marks *all* local files as in sync — use it only when you are sure nothing was modified.)

## Adopter configuration — `.union-stack/adapter.json`
Adopters legitimately need to change how two gates behave. Declare it here instead of patching the
scripts: `scripts/*.js` is the **sync** category, so `template-update --apply` overwrites local patches.
This file is adopter-owned — upstream never touches it.

```json
{
  "private": true,
  "zfsIgnored": ["mechanism.md"],
  "statusMap": { "Done": "Closed", "Review": "Verifying" },
  "evidenceFields": { "evidence": ["implementation_commit"], "closed_by": ["surfaces"] },
  "lineage": { "arithmeticFrom": 36 }
}
```

- `private: true` — this repo holds real, non-public content. The leakage gate exists to protect the
  *public template* from real content leaking in, so in a private adopter its meaning inverts:
  `health.js` reports it as **INFO (강등)** instead of FAIL. The measured count is still printed —
  the gate itself is unchanged, only the scorecard's verdict.
- `zfsIgnored: [...]` — extra fixed manifest **filenames** (not paths) exempt from ZFS naming, merged
  with the built-in exemption list.
- `statusMap: { local: upstream }` — your own status vocabulary (`Done`, `Review`, …) read **as** the
  upstream one by `zfs_index` and `work-close` (so locks, the worktable, health and the roadmap view all
  follow). Values not in the map pass through unchanged — nothing is enforced; the original is kept as
  `rawStatus`. (PRO-27 ②)
- `evidenceFields: { evidence: [...], closed_by: [...] }` — local aliases for the two closure fields.
  The upstream field wins when present; aliases are tried in order.
- `lineage.arithmeticFrom: N` — ID arithmetic (`WO-01a1-2` → `01a1` → `01a` → `01`) is applied only to IDs
  whose leading number is ≥ N; below it, only frontmatter `parent:` / `plan:` counts. Declare this when a
  legacy range numbers each domain independently (`PLAN-12` and `PRO-12` unrelated), otherwise
  `upward-fetch` inherits unrelated documents. Default 0 = arithmetic everywhere. Frontmatter parents are
  **always** read in addition to arithmetic (PRO-27 ③): `parent:` and `plan:` accept a scalar, an inline
  list or a block list, may point at any domain (an umbrella WO or a mid-level PLAN is a valid root), and are
  followed transitively by `upward-fetch`, `blast-radius` (declared children are in the blast set, locks
  included) and the roadmap-wiring observation.
- `checks: [...]` — your product checks (PRO-22): `{ name, cmd, blocking, runs_on, covers, kind, env, cost, expected_zero_unless }`.
  `node scripts/ci.js` runs them after the harness chain and appends one **receipt** line per check to
  `.union-stack/verification/raw/receipts.md` (runner-only; nobody types receipts). A check that saw
  **zero targets is a failure** for a blocking full scan; `kind: 메타` / `expected_zero_unless: diff` make it a
  NOOP_PASS, `expected_zero_unless: env` a CLARIFY. `node scripts/ci.js --scan` drafts the declarations from
  `package.json` scripts, hooks and workflows; you confirm `blocking` and `cost`. `health` shows the latest
  receipt age per blocking check; `work-close` asks WO evidence to cite `rcpt:<name>@<sha>` (new WOs only).
  `checks[].known_failures: [{ id, reason, owner, until }]` registers a tolerated exception with an owner and an
  expiry: `scripts/weakening-guard.js` (in the CI chain) lets the exception list grow only by entries whose `id`
  appears in the added lines, and turns **red** when an entry expires. Weakening signals (deleted test files,
  added skips, fewer assertions, snapshot field changes, runner-config edits, changed numeric literals in tests)
  are only ever *questions* (CLARIFY); put `weakening: <reason>` in the WO's evidence to answer them.
- `retro: { issuance, archiveDebt, staleDays, staleCount, gcPlans, planeLagDays, distill, ledgerKb, off: [...] }` — thresholds of
  the retro trigger (PRO-25): `health` shows `retro due` as WARN when any of the seven indicators crosses its threshold; the agent then
  writes one proposal line in HANDOFF §4 and a human opens the retro session. `node scripts/retro.js --record --write --adopter` drafts the
  round record (`plan/analytics/ANL-00<x>_retro_<date>.md`, `parent: up:PRO-25`). Defaults: 30 · 10 · 30d · 5 · 1 · 30d · 30 · 30 KB.
- `mnemonic: <token>` (frontmatter, any document — not adapter.json): optional override of the **derived label** that
  `sprint/next.md` and MCP `list_docs` show next to an ID (`[WO-27a-1 · prereq_upstream]`, PRO-26 ④). Without it the label is
  the first 1–2 tokens of the document's own slug, else its direct parent's. A mnemonic is inherited through `plan:`/`parent:`
  and then ID arithmetic — never across a legacy range below `lineage.arithmeticFrom` (a numeric root's label on an unrelated
  document is a false label). File names and IDs never change. `node scripts/label.js` prints the generated table.
- `localOwned: [...]` — globs (`*`, `**`, `?`, '/' separators) of files that are **yours** although they sit where template files
  sit (e.g. `scripts/verify.js`, `scripts/*-linter.js`). `template-update` neither reports them as "removed upstream" nor
  touches them on `--apply`. If a glob also covers a file the upstream ships (listed in `scripts/ship-manifest.json`), **sync
  wins** and the report warns — narrow the glob. To accept upstream for *one* forked file while keeping the other
  forks, pass paths: `node scripts/template-update.js --apply --force scripts/dashboard.js`. Scripts not listed in the manifest are local by default, so most adopters need
  no `localOwned` at all; upstream-only scripts (eval, adopter-arm, census, …) are no longer delivered and leftover copies
  are listed as removable.
- `sections: { "목표": [...], "수용 기준": [...], "증거": [...] }` — your own headings for the three required WO sections
  ([PRO-28] ①). Keys are the upstream meanings; values are local spellings (`"목적"`, `"목적·진입 조건"`, `"수용 게이트"`, `"검증"`, …).
  Headings are normalised (leading numbers, trailing colons, whitespace) and matched exactly, then by prefix. `work-close --table`
  resolves the issuance contract through the map; an unmatched document is a CLARIFY that names the map, never a REJECT, and
  existing documents are not rewritten. A `## 증거` section is not required when frontmatter `evidence:` is present.
  New WOs: `node scripts/scaffold.js WO --parent <DOMAIN-ID> --title "…" --write` (PRO-28 ④) proposes the next number under the
  parent (or domain max + 1 below `lineage.arithmeticFrom`), refuses a dead parent or an existing file, and writes the three
  required sections using the **first alias** of each key in your `sections` map — so new documents follow your own spelling.
  Reading: `node scripts/upward-fetch.js <ID> --sections [names]` ([PRO-28] ③) injects only the contract sections of each parent
  document (resolved through the same map, plus any names you pass) and lists the omitted sections with their token size, so a
  session no longer opens a 40–80 KB plan whole. The default output is unchanged.
- `budgets: { project, profile, handoff, total }` — recalibrated bootstrap token budgets (positive integers; defaults 2000 · 800 ·
  1500 · 4000). `context-budget`, `handoff-linter`, `health` and the dashboard read them, so a repo whose HANDOFF legitimately
  needs 2,200 tokens declares it here instead of forking `context-budget.js` (a fork is overwritten or preserved stale on every
  update — an adopter did exactly that and lost the upstream CJK token coefficient). Unknown keys and non-positive values warn.
- `upstreamIgnored: [...]` — globs of upstream files this repo **refuses** (e.g. `.github/workflows/harness.yml` in a repo that
  retired GitHub Actions and gates through `docker-compose.harness.yml` + `scripts/ci.js`). Unlike `localOwned`, a refusal beats the
  ship manifest: the file is neither delivered, re-delivered on the next `--apply`, nor reported. Refusing a `scripts/` file is
  reported as a possible gate weakening (the CI chain skips absent steps), so keep refusals to CI/config files.
- Documents without a `status:` line are counted as *nothing* by every tool. List them with
  `node scripts/frontmatter-backfill.js` (dry-run: estimate from a body marker such as `Status: Done`,
  then from an `archived/` directory, else left blank and reported) and apply with `--apply` — it inserts
  **one `status:` line** in your own vocabulary; the map above does the rest. Upstream never edits your
  documents: the script and the dry-run are its part, applying and committing are yours.

Unknown keys and wrong types are reported as warnings rather than silently ignored — a typo that looks
applied but isn't is the standard failure of this kind of config.

Two adopter-owned files sit next to it, and `template-update` never touches either:
`.union-stack/template-sync.json` (the last-coherent anchor — written by `--apply`, seeded by `init.js`)
and, if you add one, `scripts/dashboard.local.js` (below).

## Adopter dashboard sections — `--sections`
`scripts/dashboard.js` is a **sync** file, so forking it to add your own section loses the edit on the next
`--apply`. Ship your sections in an adopter-owned module instead:

```js
// scripts/dashboard.local.js
module.exports = [
  { id: 'kpi', title: '제품 KPI', axis: 'product',
    render: d => `<div class="meta">docs ${d.index.length} · WO ${d.wos.length}</div>` },
  { id: 'ops', title: '운영 지표', axis: 'ops', axisLabel: '운영',   // new axis id → new page + nav entry
    render: d => '…' },
];
```

```bash
node scripts/dashboard.js --sections scripts/dashboard.local.js
```

`render(gathered)` is a pure data → HTML-fragment function, the same contract the built-in sections use;
`gathered` is what `gatherAll()` returns (`index`, `health`, `budget`, `wos`, `sprint`, `time`, `product`,
`today`). The card shell (`<section>` + heading) is added by the host, and a section that throws prints the
error inside its own card — the rest of the page still renders. A module that fails to load is reported on
stderr with exit 1 (the dashboard is still written, without those sections).

## Compatibility notes (what carries over for free)
- **ZFS Luhmann IDs ↔ existing PLAN/ID lineage**: if you already number plans hierarchically, the IDs map 1:1 — no conversion needed. Existing Zettelkasten/Folgezettel users inherit lineage directly.
- **Drift/gap docs map directly**: an existing `gap.md` / drift log → `.union-stack/verification/derived/gap.md` with no reshaping.
- **3-tier permission as a role clarifier**: deciding "is this Schema or Wiki?" for each file is, in practice, a fast and clarifying way to assign each doc its role during migration.

## Large docs
union-stack files are small skeletons; real docs grow. When a doc exceeds ~30KB (`node scripts/health.js` warns), split it along its ZFS lineage and/or rotate older entries — see `DESIGN_RATIONALE.md` (§7, rotation protocol).

## Upgrading from an older union-stack
For the full per-version change list, see [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md) (entries marked **⚠** require a migration action). The one structural change so far:

Two directories were renamed for clarity (folder name now matches its meaning):

| Old (pre-v5.x) | Current | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `topology/` | `architecture/` | matches the `ARCH` domain; "architecture norms" is clearer |
| `mechanism/` | `verification/` | "mechanism" collides with "architectural mechanism"; this plane verifies |

Move the folders and update any bracket-ID/text references; IDs themselves are unchanged.

### ⚠ PRO-14 — add the re-proposal blocks marker to your AGENTS.md
`AGENTS.md` is a *review*-category file (upstream reports drift; it never overwrites yours), so this
one block must be added by hand. Paste it into the bootstrap section, then run the compiler:

```markdown
### ⛔ 재제안 차단 목록 ([PRO-14] — 결정된 것을 다시 꺼내지 마라)
<!-- blocks-index:begin — generated by `node scripts/blocks-index.js --write`; do not hand-edit -->
- (없음)
<!-- blocks-index:end -->
```

Then `node scripts/blocks-index.js --write`. Until the block exists the gate reports CLARIFY (exit 3,
non-blocking) rather than failing. **No retro-labelling** of existing ledger rows is required — the
ledger is append-only, so mark only the few decisions that must not be relitigated, in new entries.

### ⚠ PRO-15 — turn `sprint/next.md` into a generated worktable
Replace your hand-maintained active table with the marker block, then compile it from your `WO-*` docs:

```markdown
# Sprint — Active
<!-- worktable:begin — generated by `node scripts/work-close.js --table --write`; do not hand-edit -->
<!-- worktable:end -->
```

Then `node scripts/work-close.js --table --write`. Any work orders you tracked as table rows become
`sprint/WO-<id>_<slug>.md` documents whose frontmatter `status:` is the single source of truth
(`Draft → Active → Verifying → Closed`); the table is regenerated from them, so a closed WO leaves the
view by itself. Closed WOs move to `sprint/archived/` at session end and are **never deleted** — they
must stay indexed for the GC condition in `plan/_GUIDE.md` to remain computable.

Also: `Live` was removed from the lock vocabulary — search your docs for `Verifying/Live` and drop the
`Live` half. No node can have had that status (it was never indexable), so nothing unlocks in practice.

## Validate
```bash
node scripts/zfs-linter.js      # naming
node scripts/health.js          # gates + structural metrics (size, refs, domain use)
node scripts/ref-linter.js      # bracket-ID reference integrity (advisory)
node scripts/blocks-index.js    # re-proposal blocks index in sync (CLARIFY, never blocks)
node scripts/work-close.js --table   # worktable view in sync with WO docs (CLARIFY)
```
